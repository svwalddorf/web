# SV Walddorf's redaction system and website

## What is this?

The redaction system is built with Strapi, a headless CMS. It is used to manage the content of the website.

The website is built with Next.js, a React framework, and Tailwind CSS.

## Color scheme

We use the club's main color as our base color: _Sky blue_, Hex: `#057DB1`, RGB: `5`,`125`,`177`.

The color palette is color-blind safe and accessible.
